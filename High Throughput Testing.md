# 96 Well Protein Expressions and Prep

### Day 1: OVERNIGHTS

1. Pick a single colony from plate and inoculate 0.5ml of room temp LB/Kan (NOT TB) in STERILE deep well plate (Round bottom 2 mL Deep well plate; e.g. Cat No # 278743)
 * Generally we have been picking and growing up 4 individual colonies/mutation, so we have quadruplicate data on each mutation. Plate assays have a lot of variability and each colony is not guaranteed to have the mutation, so quadruplicate assaying helps significantly.
2. Cover with breathable seal
3. Shake at 37deg 16-24hrs in warm room plate shaker (Heidolph Brinkmann Titramax 1000 @ 1200rpm) to ensure they are all fully grown

### Day 2: EXPRESSION

1. Vortex the overnights at 1500rpm for 30sec to ensure to mix any cells that have settled to the bottom into the media.
 * Make glycerol stocks if first time doing this set: 110uL cells + 110uL 20% glycerol. Store in -80.
2. Inoculate a fresh STERILE plate of 1.0ml of TB/Kan in a deep well plate with 20uL of overnight cultures
3. Cover with breathable seal
4. Grow at 37deg as above for 3 hours (target OD approx 0.3-0.8)
5. Add IPTG to 0.5mM (50uL of 10mM IPTG) using the repeater
6. Transfer plate to 18deg shaker (Heidolph Brinkmann Titramax+Incubator 1000 @ 1200rpm in cold room, preheat to 18) and shake at 1200rpm for 24-30hrs.

### Day 3: STORE

1. Spin down cells at 4000rpm for 20min
2. Pour off supernatant
3. Store cells in -20 until ready for purification

### Day 3/4: PURIFICATION (~3hrs minimum)

1. Lyse cells via BugBuster (~30min) or Freeze/Thaw Cycles (~3hours)
#### FREEZE/THAW
 * With repeater add 250uL of appropriate lysis buffer and re-suspend with mixmate (5min at 1500rpm) OR with Pipettman
 * Place plates in -80 for 15 minutes to freeze
 * Pull plates out and let thaw for 35 minutes. Shake plate at 1500rpm while thawing.
 * If doing multiple plates, then rotate plates letting each plate shake for 10minutes.
 * Make sure cells have thawed, then place back in -80 and repeat so cells are frozen a total of 3 times! If cells have not thawed let mix at room temp for longer!
#### BUGBUSTER
 * With repeater add 250uL of appropriate lysis buffer and re-suspend with mixmate (2min at 1000rpm) OR with Pipettman
 * Continue to incubate at room temp for 20min, mixing with plate mixer (1000rpm).
  * If you are worried about protein stability then incubate in the cold room for one-
hour using plate shaker to continuously mix (1200rpm).

 * Pellet Insoluble Matter &amp; Clarify Supernatant (~1 hour)
 * Spin the lysis for 60min at 4000rpm (spin longer if supernatant is not clear enough. But one hour should really be sufficient!)
 * If the supernatant still looks cloudy you need to clarify first, but if clear this step can be skipped.
 * To clarify: Carefully transfer 200uL of supernatant to a Millipore Multiscreen-HTS DV 0.65um hydrophil low protein binding filter plate (Part #: MSDVN6550) with a Costar V-bottom plate (fisher part #: 07-200- 695) taped below as a collection plate.
  * Try to avoid picking up pellet, but a small amount is normal to pick up in this step.
 Spin 2000g for 20minutes (or until most of the supernatant has gone through)

o Purification (~1 hrs)
 Bind Clarified Supernatant (~40min)
 Tape a Costar V-bottom plate underneath a of a Millipore Multiscreen-HTS DV 1.2um
hydrophil low protein binding filter plate (Part #: MSBVN1250).
 Aliquot 100uL of 50% NiNTA slurry to each well

o BE FAST, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THE BEADS DON’T SETTLE
TOO MUCH WHILE YOU ARE ALIQUOUTING. If using a pipette use a
P1000 since the resin tends to clog the smaller 200uL tips!

 Add 200uL of wash buffer
 Spin 1500rpm for 1min
 Use 200uL multichannel to add clarified lysate to each well (~200uL/well)
o Be careful to NOT TOUCH the cell pellet. I find one of the best ways to do this
is to use a small piece of cardboard and tape it to the pipette such that it can’t go
low enough to touch the cell pellet.

 Mix in plate mixer for 30min (700rpm or just fast enough so liquid is not coming out
of the well! Start slow and work your way up!)
 Spin 1500rpm for 5min
 Discard flow through
 Wash off unbound protein (~20min)
 With repeater apply 200uL of wash buffer to each well.
 Incubate for 1min while mixing in plate mixer (same speed as determined before)
 Spin 1500rpm for 5min
 Discard flow through and repeat 2 more times (wash with ~12 c.v. or 600uL of wash
buffer in total)
 Elute Protein (~5min)
 Switch out collection plate to a new V-bottom plate. Tape on so the collection plate does
not slip!
 With repeater add 100uL of elution buffer (500mM Imidizole) to each well.
 Mix in plate mixer (same speed as determined before) for 10min.
 Spin 5min 1500rpm.
o You should now have your protein!
 We have generally been getting approx. 0.1-10.0mg/ml of protein off the column for the NiNTA
prep (depending on the protein) and about 5-fold less in the straight cell lysis prep.

o Clean NiNTA for Re-Use
 The NiNTA Resin is the most expensive part of this assay, so if you are doing MANY PLATES it
is worth trying to save!
 Pipette 200uL of water into each well and transfer to a multichannel tray
 Use 1mL Multichannel, no need to change tips between wells.
 Pour tray in 50mL falcon tube
 The Following wash procedure is adapted from the QIAExpressionist for regenerating NiNTA
 Spin for 5min at 800rpm and then carefully decant supernatant
 Fill with Water, spin 5min 800rpm and decant
 Fill with 2%-SDS, spin 5min 800rpm and decant
 Fill with Water, spin 5min 800rpm and decant
 Fill with 100mM EDTA pH 8, spin 5min 800rpm and decant
 Fill with Water, spin 5min 800rpm and decant
 Fill with 100mM NiSO4, spin 5min 800rpm and decant
 Fill with Water, spin 5min 800rpm and decant
 Add 25% Ethanol until beads are in ~50% slurry, STORE AT 4degC
